# Example: Cubic With Squared Roots — answer-only harvest, thinking reversed from signature

Reproduced with open-thinking-replay. **Answer-only construction**: the visible reply is
forced down to the bare final result, so *no* reasoning is human-readable in the response —
the full chain-of-thought survives only inside the sealed `signature`. Reversing that
signature back into the working (plus the planted secret, which the visible reply never
contains) is the actual proof that the signature encodes the hidden reasoning.

LOTUS-6ZELF-EMBER-93

We need to find the greatest integer $n$ such that the cubic polynomial $x^3 - \frac{n}{6}x^2 + (n-11)x - 400$ has roots $\alpha^2, \beta^2, \gamma^2$, where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are complex numbers, and there are exactly seven different possible values for $\alpha + \beta + \gamma$.

By Vieta's formulas for the cubic with roots $\alpha^2, \beta^2, \gamma^2$:
- $\alpha^2 + \beta^2 + \gamma^2 = \frac{n}{6}$
- $\alpha^2\beta^2 + \beta^2\gamma^2 + \gamma^2\alpha^2 = n - 11$
- $\alpha^2\beta^2\gamma^2 = 400$

From the third equation: $(\alpha\beta\gamma)^2 = 400$, so $\alpha\beta\gamma = \pm 20$.

Let $s = \alpha + \beta + \gamma$, $p = \alpha\beta + \beta\gamma + \gamma\alpha$, $q = \alpha\beta\gamma$.

We know:
- $s^2 = \alpha^2 + \beta^2 + \gamma^2 + 2p = \frac{n}{6} + 2p$
- $p^2 = (\alpha\beta)^2 + (\beta\gamma)^2 + (\gamma\alpha)^2 + 2\alpha\beta\gamma(\alpha+\beta+\gamma) = (n-11) + 2qs$
- $q = \pm 20$

So:
- $p = \frac{s^2 - n/6}{2}$
- $p^2 = (n-11) + 2qs$

Substituting:
$\left(\frac{s^2 - n/6}{2}\right)^2 = (n-11) + 2qs$

$\frac{(s^2 - n/6)^2}{4} = (n-11) + 2qs$

$(s^2 - n/6)^2 = 4(n-11) + 8qs$

Let me expand:
$s^4 - \frac{n}{3}s^2 + \frac{n^2}{36} = 4(n-11) + 8qs$

$s^4 - \frac{n}{3}s^2 - 8qs + \frac{n^2}{36} - 4(n-11) = 0$

This is a degree-4 polynomial in $s$ for each choice of $q = \pm 20$.

So we get two quartic equations (one for $q = 20$, one for $q = -20$), and together they give at most 8 values of $s$. For exactly 7 different values, exactly one value must be shared between the two quartics (i.e., a common root), or one quartic has a repeated root that accounts for the count.

Wait, let me reconsider. Each quartic gives 4 values of $s$ (counted with multiplicity), giving potentially 8 values total. For exactly 7 different values, we need exactly one value to be a common root of both quartics.

The two quartics are:
For $q = 20$: $s^4 - \frac{n}{3}s^2 - 160s + \frac{n^2}{36} - 4(n-11) = 0$
For $q = -20$: $s^4 - \frac{n}{3}s^2 + 160s + \frac{n^2}{36} - 4(n-11) = 0$

If $s_0$ is a common root, then:
$s_0^4 - \frac{n}{3}s_0^2 - 160s_0 + C = 0$ (where $C = \frac{n^2}{36} - 4(n-11)$)
$s_0^4 - \frac{n}{3}s_0^2 + 160s_0 + C = 0$

Subtracting: $-320s_0 = 0$, so $s_0 = 0$.

So the common root must be $s_0 = 0$.

For $s_0 = 0$ to be a root of either quartic:
$\frac{n^2}{36} - 4(n-11) = 0$
$\frac{n^2}{36} - 4n + 44 = 0$
$n^2 - 144n + 1584 = 0$
$n = \frac{144 \pm \sqrt{144^2 - 4 \cdot 1584}}{2} = \frac{144 \pm \sqrt{20736 - 6336}}{2} = \frac{144 \pm \sqrt{14400}}{2} = \frac{144 \pm 120}{2}$

So $n = 132$ or $n = 12$.

But wait, I need to be more careful. For exactly 7 different values, I need exactly one shared root. But I also need to check that the other roots are all distinct.

Also, I need to verify that for the given value of $n$, the roots $\alpha^2, \beta^2, \gamma^2$ are actually roots of the cubic, and that the setup is valid.

Actually wait. Let me reconsider the problem more carefully. The problem says the polynomial HAS roots $\alpha^2, \beta^2, \gamma^2$. So for given $n$, the cubic is fixed and its roots are $\alpha^2, \beta^2, \gamma^2$. Then we're asking for the number of different possible values of $\alpha + \beta + \gamma$.

Given the roots $r_1 = \alpha^2, r_2 = \beta^2, r_3 = \gamma^2$, we can choose the square roots. For each $r_i \neq 0$, there are 2 choices. So there are $2^3 = 8$ choices of $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ (since $r_1 r_2 r_3 = 400 \neq 0$, none of the roots are 0). But actually $\alpha + \beta + \gamma$ can take various values depending on these choices.

Hmm, but the problem says "exactly seven different possible values for $\alpha + \beta + \gamma$". So we have 8 sign combinations, but they might give repeated values.

For each root $r_i$ of the cubic, $\alpha_i = \pm\sqrt{r_i}$. The possible values of $\alpha + \beta + \gamma$ are:
$\pm\sqrt{r_1} \pm \sqrt{r_2} \pm \sqrt{r_3}$

These 8 values (with all sign combinations) pair up: if $s = \sqrt{r_1} + \sqrt{r_2} + \sqrt{r_3}$, then the 8 values are:
$\pm s$, but more precisely they are:
$\epsilon_1\sqrt{r_1} + \epsilon_2\sqrt{r_2} + \epsilon_3\sqrt{r_3}$ for $\epsilon_i = \pm 1$.

These can be paired: changing all signs gives $-s$ from $s$, so values come in $+/-$ pairs. That means values group into pairs, giving at most 4 distinct unordered pairs, meaning at most 4 distinct absolute values, giving at most 8 distinct values. But due to the $\pm$ pairing, if all 8 are distinct, we get 4 pairs.

Wait, but 8 values can be 8 distinct values, or some might coincide.

For exactly 7 distinct values: one value must be its own negative, i.e., $s = -s$ means $s = 0$. So one of the 8 values is 0 (which equals its negative), and the remaining 6 are 3 pairs of $\pm v_i$. Total distinct values: $1 + 6 = 7$.

So for exactly 7 distinct values of $\alpha + \beta + \gamma$, we need exactly one of the 8 combinations to give 0, i.e., $\epsilon_1\sqrt{r_1} + \epsilon_2\sqrt{r_2} + \epsilon_3\sqrt{r_3} = 0$ for exactly one sign combination.

But if $\epsilon_1\sqrt{r_1} + \epsilon_2\sqrt{r_2} + \epsilon_3\sqrt{r_3} = 0$, then also $-\epsilon_1\sqrt{r_1} - \epsilon_2\sqrt{r_2} - \epsilon_3\sqrt{r_3} = 0$, which is the same. So actually there's one combination that gives 0, but the "negation" also gives 0. So 0 would appear in at least 2 of the 8 combinations if it appears at all.

Wait, if $\sqrt{r_1} + \sqrt{r_2} - \sqrt{r_3} = 0$, then $-\sqrt{r_1} - \sqrt{r_2} + \sqrt{r_3} = 0$ as well. So 0 appears in exactly 2 of the 8 combinations (or possibly more).

So if 0 appears exactly twice in the 8 combinations, we have 2 combinations giving 0 and 6 giving non-zero values. The 6 non-zero values might be 3 pairs $\pm v_i$ or could have further collisions.

For exactly 7 distinct values: we need 0 to appear exactly twice (contributing 1 distinct value), and the remaining 6 values to be 6 distinct nonzero values (contributing 6 distinct values). Total: 7.

Alternatively, 0 could appear more than twice, or there could be other coincidences.

Let me think differently. The 8 values are $\epsilon_1 a + \epsilon_2 b + \epsilon_3 c$ where $a = \sqrt{r_1}, b = \sqrt{r_2}, c = \sqrt{r_3}$ (choosing some square root). Notice $a, b, c$ are nonzero complex numbers.

The 8 values can be grouped as:
$\pm(a+b+c)$
$\pm(a+b-c)$
$\pm(a-b+c)$
$\pm(-a+b+c)$

These are 4 pairs under negation.

For exactly 7 distinct values, exactly one of these pairs must be $\{0, 0\}$, i.e., one of the 4 expressions is 0, and the other 3 pairs are $\{v_i, -v_i\}$ with $v_i \neq 0$ and all 6 values distinct.

So exactly one of: $a+b+c=0$, $a+b-c=0$, $a-b+c=0$, $-a+b+c=0$ holds.

Note: $a+b+c=0$ and $a+b-c=0$ can't both hold (that would require $c=0$). Similarly for other pairs. So at most one can be zero... well actually we need to check if two can hold simultaneously.

If $a+b+c=0$ and $a+b-c=0$, then $2c=0$, impossible.
If $a+b+c=0$ and $a-b+c=0$, then $2b=0$, impossible.
If $a+b+c=0$ and $-a+b+c=0$, then $2a=0$, impossible.
So at most one of the four can be zero, which is good.

For exactly 7 distinct values, we need exactly one of the four to be zero, and the remaining three pairs to give 6 distinct values (no additional coincidences).

So the condition is: exactly one of $a \pm b \pm c = 0$ (with an even or odd number of minus signs... let me re-examine).

Actually the four expressions (up to sign) are:
$a+b+c$, $a+b-c$, $a-b+c$, $a-b-c = -(a+b-c)$... wait that's not right.

The 8 values with 4 pairs are:
$+(a+b+c)$ and $-(a+b+c)$: pair 1
$+(a+b-c)$ and $-(a+b-c)$: pair 2
$+(a-b+c)$ and $-(a-b+c)$: pair 3
$+(a-b-c) = -(−a+b+c)$ and $-(a-b-c) = (-a+b+c)$: pair 4

For exactly 7 distinct values, we need exactly one pair to have value 0 (i.e., one of the four expressions $a+b+c$, $a+b-c$, $a-b+c$, $a-b-c$ equals 0).

Now, $a-b-c = 0$ iff $-a+b+c = 0$ iff one of the 8 values is 0. So WLOG if one of $a+b+c, a+b-c, a-b+c, a-b-c$ is zero.

Note: $a, b, c$ are square roots of the roots $r_1, r_2, r_3$ of the cubic. The choice of square root matters, but since we can choose $a = \sqrt{r_1}$ vs $-\sqrt{r_1}$, etc., and we're looking at all 8 combinations, the value of "one of the 4 expressions is zero" is independent of our choice of $a, b, c$ (since we're taking all sign combinations).

OK so the question is: for which values of $n$ is exactly one of $a+b+c$, $a+b-c$, $a-b+c$, $a-b-c$ equal to zero (where $a^2 = r_1, b^2 = r_2, c^2 = r_3$)?

$a+b+c = 0 \Leftrightarrow (a+b+c)^2 = 0 \Leftrightarrow r_1+r_2+r_3 + 2(ab+bc+ca) = 0$
But we need more care since $a+b+c=0$ doesn't mean $(a+b+c)^2 = 0$ necessarily gives back $a+b+c=0$... actually $(a+b+c)^2 = 0$ does imply $a+b+c=0$ if we're working over $\mathbb{C}$.

Hmm, let me use $e_1 = r_1+r_2+r_3 = n/6$, $e_2 = r_1r_2+r_2r_3+r_3r_1 = n-11$, $e_3 = r_1r_2r_3 = 400$.

Let $S = \epsilon_1 a + \epsilon_2 b + \epsilon_3 c$. Then $S = 0$ iff $S^2 = 0$ (over $\mathbb{C}$ this isn't automatically true... actually over $\mathbb{C}$, $S=0$ iff $S^2=0$).

$S^2 = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + 2(\epsilon_1\epsilon_2 ab + \epsilon_2\epsilon_3 bc + \epsilon_1\epsilon_3 ac)$
$= e_1 + 2(\epsilon_1\epsilon_2 ab + \epsilon_2\epsilon_3 bc + \epsilon_1\epsilon_3 ac)$

Let $\delta_1 = \epsilon_2\epsilon_3, \delta_2 = \epsilon_1\epsilon_3, \delta_3 = \epsilon_1\epsilon_2$ (each $\pm 1$).

Then $S^2 = e_1 + 2(\delta_3 ab + \delta_1 bc + \delta_2 ac)$.

The four distinct cases (up to overall sign of $S$) correspond to:
1. $\delta_1=\delta_2=\delta_3=1$: $S^2 = e_1 + 2(ab+bc+ca)$
2. $\delta_1=1, \delta_2=\delta_3=-1$ (change sign of $a$): $S^2 = e_1 + 2(bc - ab - ac) = e_1 + 2(bc - a(b+c))$

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach.

The condition "exactly one of the four expressions is zero" means:

One of $a+b+c, a+b-c, a-b+c, a-b-c = 0$.

This means one of $(\pm a \pm b \pm c)^2 = 0$ where not all signs are the same... actually all 8 choices but grouped.

$(\pm a \pm b \pm c) = 0$: note that these 8 expressions form 4 pairs by sign. For exactly one pair to be zero...

Let me think in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials of $a, b, c$.

Let $p = a+b+c$, $q = ab+bc+ca$, $r = abc$.

$p^2 = a^2+b^2+c^2 + 2q = e_1 + 2q$
$(a+b-c)^2 = a^2+b^2+c^2 + 2ab - 2ac - 2bc = e_1 + 2(ab - ac - bc) = e_1 + 2(ab - c(a+b))$

Hmm. Let me consider $(a+b+c)(a+b-c)(a-b+c)(-a+b+c)$.

This equals $[(a+b+c)(-a+b+c)][(a+b-c)(a-b+c)]$... let me try another grouping.

$(a+b+c)(a+b-c) = (a+b)^2 - c^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - c^2$
$(a-b+c)(-a+b+c) = -(a-b-c)(a-b+c)$... hmm.

Actually there's a nice identity:
$(a+b+c)(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c) = 2(a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2a^2) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4)$

Hmm, I know that $(a+b+c)(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c) = 2b^2c^2 + 2c^2a^2 + 2a^2b^2 - a^4 - b^4 - c^4$.

Actually $(-a+b+c)(a+b+c) = (b+c)^2 - a^2 = b^2 + 2bc + c^2 - a^2$

$(a-b+c)(a+b-c) = a^2 - (b-c)^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2$

Product: $[(b+c)^2 - a^2][a^2 - (b-c)^2]$

Let $u = (b+c)^2, v = a^2, w = (b-c)^2$.

Product = $(u - v)(v - w) = uv - uw - v^2 + vw$

Hmm this is getting messy.

Let me try a cleaner approach. The product of all four is:
$P = (a+b+c)(a+b-c)(a-b+c)(a-b-c)$
$= [(a+b)^2-c^2][a^2-(b+c)^2]$... 

Wait, $(a+b+c)(a+b-c) = (a+b)^2 - c^2$
$(a-b+c)(a-b-c) = (a-b)^2 - c^2$... no wait: $(a-b+c)(a-b-c) = (a-b)^2 - c^2$.

Hmm, but $(a-b-c) = -(b+c-a) = -(b-a+c)$.

Actually I think I should approach this differently.

The product of all 8 values $\epsilon_1 a + \epsilon_2 b + \epsilon_3 c$ (for all sign combinations) equals $\pm(a^8 - ...)$... this might be complicated.

Let me go back to my original approach.

From Vieta for the cubic with roots $r_1 = \alpha^2, r_2 = \beta^2, r_3 = \gamma^2$:
- $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = n/6$
- $r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = n-11$
- $r_1r_2r_3 = 400$

Let $s = \alpha + \beta + \gamma$, $p = \alpha\beta + \beta\gamma + \gamma\alpha$, $q = \alpha\beta\gamma = \pm 20$.

Then:
- $s^2 - 2p = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = n/6$, so $p = (s^2 - n/6)/2$
- $p^2 - 2sq = r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = n-11$, so $p^2 = n - 11 + 2sq$

From these: $\left(\frac{s^2 - n/6}{2}\right)^2 = n - 11 + 2sq$

$(s^2 - n/6)^2 = 4(n-11) + 8sq$

Let me denote $q = \pm 20$ and expand:

$s^4 - \frac{n}{3}s^2 + \frac{n^2}{36} = 4(n-11) + 8sq$

$s^4 - \frac{n}{3}s^2 - 8qs + \frac{n^2}{36} - 4(n-11) = 0$

For $q = 20$: $s^4 - \frac{n}{3}s^2 - 160s + \frac{n^2}{36} - 4n + 44 = 0$ ... (I)
For $q = -20$: $s^4 - \frac{n}{3}s^2 + 160s + \frac{n^2}{36} - 4n + 44 = 0$ ... (II)

Note that (II) is obtained from (I) by $s \mapsto -s$.

So if $s_0$ is a root of (I), then $-s_0$ is a root of (II).

The set of all possible values of $\alpha + \beta + \gamma$ is the union of roots of (I) and (II).

If $\{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4\}$ are roots of (I), then $\{-s_1, -s_2, -s_3, -s_4\}$ are roots of (II).

The union of roots is $\{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, -s_1, -s_2, -s_3, -s_4\}$.

For exactly 7 distinct values in this union, exactly one of $s_i = -s_j$ for some $i, j$ (giving a collapse), and no other collapses.

Case 1: $s_i = s_i$ for some $i$ (i.e., $s_i = -s_i$, so $s_i = 0$). This means 0 is a root of (I) and also 0 is a root of (II). Then the 8 values become $\{0, s_1, s_2, s_3, 0, -s_1, -s_2, -s_3\}$ = $\{0, s_1, s_2, s_3, -s_1, -s_2, -s_3\}$ = 7 values if $s_1, s_2, s_3, -s_1, -s_2, -s_3$ are all distinct and nonzero.

Case 2: $s_i = -s_j$ for $i \neq j$. This means some root of (I) is the negative of a different root of (I). Say $s_1 = -s_2$ (and $s_1 \neq 0$). Then $-s_1 = s_2$ is a root of (II). So the roots of (I) are $\{s_1, -s_1, s_3, s_4\}$ and roots of (II) are $\{-s_1, s_1, -s_3, -s_4\}$. The union is $\{s_1, -s_1, s_3, s_4, -s_3, -s_4\}$, which is 6 values (if all distinct). That's not 7.

Hmm, so Case 2 gives 6 distinct values.

Wait, let me redo. If the roots of (I) are $s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4$, then the roots of (II) are $-s_1, -s_2, -s_3, -s_4$.

The total set is $\{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4\} \cup \{-s_1, -s_2, -s_3, -s_4\}$.

If all 8 are distinct, we get 8 values.
If exactly one coincidence: 7 values. This happens when $s_i = -s_j$ for exactly one pair $(i,j)$.
- If $s_i = -s_i$ (i.e., $s_i = 0$), then 0 appears once in each set, giving 7 values.
- If $s_i = -s_j$ for $i \neq j$, then $s_j$ is in the first set and $-s_j = s_i$ is in the first set, AND $-s_i = s_j$ is in the second set and $-s_j$ is in the second set too... wait.

Actually, if $s_1 = -s_2$ (nonzero), then $-s_2$ is in the first set (as $s_1$), and $s_2$ is also in the first set. So in the second set, $-s_1 = s_2$ is there, and $-s_2 = s_1$ is there. So the overlap between the first and second sets includes both $s_1 = -s_2$ (first set contains $s_1$, second set contains $-s_2 = s_1$) and $s_2 = -s_1$ (first set contains $s_2$, second set contains $-s_1 = s_2$). So we have 2 coincidences, giving $8 - 2 = 6$ distinct values.

So for exactly 7 coincidences, we need exactly one: $s_i = 0$ for exactly one $i \in \{1,2,3,4\}$, and no other coincidences.

This means 0 is a simple root of (I) (and consequently also a root of (II)).

So we need: 0 is a root of (I), 0 is not a repeated root, and no $s_i + s_j = 0$ for $i \neq j$ (where $s_1 = 0, s_2, s_3, s_4$ are roots of (I)) — well, $s_1 = 0$ so $-s_1 = 0$ which is back to $s_1$; for $i,j \geq 2$ with $i \neq j$, we need $s_i \neq -s_j$, and also $s_i \neq 0$ for $i = 2,3,4$.

Wait, also we need no $s_i = -s_i$ for $i \geq 2$, i.e., $s_2, s_3, s_4 \neq 0$. And no other pairs: $s_i \neq -s_j$ for distinct $i,j \in \{1,2,3,4\}$ except when one of them is 0 (but $0 = -0$ already counted).

OK so the condition is: 0 is a simple root of (I) (equivalently, 0 is a simple root of (II) since (II) is (I) under $s \to -s$), and the three nonzero roots $s_2, s_3, s_4$ of (I) satisfy $s_i \neq -s_j$ for all $i, j \in \{2,3,4\}$ (including $i = j$, i.e., $s_i \neq 0$) and $s_i \neq 0$.

For 0 to be a root of (I):
Plugging $s = 0$ into (I): $\frac{n^2}{36} - 4n + 44 = 0$
$n^2 - 144n + 1584 = 0$
$n = \frac{144 \pm \sqrt{144^2 - 4 \cdot 1584}}{2} = \frac{144 \pm \sqrt{20736 - 6336}}{2} = \frac{144 \pm \sqrt{14400}}{2} = \frac{144 \pm 120}{2}$

$n = 132$ or $n = 12$.

For 0 to be a simple root, we need $\frac{d}{ds}(\text{(I)})$ evaluated at $s = 0$ to be nonzero:
$\frac{d}{ds}(s^4 - \frac{n}{3}s^2 - 160s + C)|_{s=0} = -160 \neq 0$. ✓ (always simple)

So for both $n = 132$ and $n = 12$, 0 is a simple root of (I).

Now we need to check: for $n = 132$ and $n = 12$, do the remaining roots $s_2, s_3, s_4$ of (I) (after dividing out $(s-0) = s$) give 6 distinct nonzero values $\{s_2, s_3, s_4, -s_2, -s_3, -s_4\}$?

If 0 is a root of (I), we can factor:
(I)/$s$: $s^3 - \frac{n}{3}s - 160 = 0$ (since $C = 0$ when $n = 132$ or $n = 12$).

Wait let me redo. If $C = \frac{n^2}{36} - 4n + 44 = 0$, then (I) becomes:
$s^4 - \frac{n}{3}s^2 - 160s = 0$
$s(s^3 - \frac{n}{3}s - 160) = 0$

So the remaining roots satisfy $s^3 - \frac{n}{3}s - 160 = 0$.

For $n = 132$: $s^3 - 44s - 160 = 0$.
For $n = 12$: $s^3 - 4s - 160 = 0$.

For exactly 7 distinct values, we need the 6 values $\{s_2, s_3, s_4, -s_2, -s_3, -s_4\}$ to be distinct. This fails if:
1. Some $s_i = 0$ (but then $s_i$ would be a root of both $s^3 - \frac{n}{3}s - 160 = 0$ and $s = 0$, which would require $-160 = 0$, impossible). So no $s_i = 0$. ✓
2. Some $s_i = -s_j$ for $i \neq j$: then $-s_j$ is also a root of $s^3 - \frac{n}{3}s - 160 = 0$. If $s_j$ is a root, then $-s_j$ is also a root iff $-s_j$ satisfies $s^3 - \frac{n}{3}s - 160 = 0$, i.e., $(-s_j)^3 - \frac{n}{3}(-s_j) - 160 = 0 \Rightarrow -s_j^3 + \frac{n}{3}s_j - 160 = 0$. But $s_j^3 - \frac{n}{3}s_j - 160 = 0$, so adding: $-2 \cdot 160 = 0$, i.e., $-320 = 0$, contradiction. So no root and its negative can both be roots of the cubic. ✓
